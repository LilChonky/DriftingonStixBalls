Going crazy mode on them thangs

There is a very small amount of prework you need to complete to get this to work including downloading an audio file and placing it in a new folder in your WoW Retail directory. 

Prework, Custom Audio Files in WoW:
  We need to give our custom sound file a place to live and the WA is looking only in a very specific spot. Though this is something you can customize later if you'd like. 

  Naviagte to C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface
    Likely you will only see the AddOns folder here, youre in the right spot.
    Right click and create a new folder here named "CustomAudio"
    Double check the name is exactly correct and then navigate into your now empty folder. 
    Place our custom audio file inside this file (aiauw-tit7w.ogg)

  Import the WA text thats in this repo in just the same way you have for every other WA 

  Restart your game. Unless something has changed recently World of Warcraft does not read new files added to it while the game is open so you'll have to fully restart. Though you could /reload and see *shrug*
